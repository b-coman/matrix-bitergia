Yeah no hurry on when the rotation happens. I just realize I don't have as much bandwidth as Daniel will have. He is also a core contributor to the Hydra project, so some Cardano relevance, but is even more involved with other open source communities around nix, haskell and gitlab (as far as I know).

In the GovTools working group we come to the discussion of prioritisation: some members of the group would provide feature suggestions to populate backlog, while others will need to decide what needs to be done first. On the whim of fates I find myself in the position of a chair of this second group, whose goal is to prioritise the work packages and issues provided by the first group. The issue at hand is that if discussing the items directly the complexity of discussion will presumably in the future stall the development: it is something that is described in detail in Alternative Dispute Resolution and treaties on ontology of conflict (conflict of interest between involved parties). The proposed solution is to agree on objective criteria for ranking options before viewing options themselves. But here I am facing a blocker and need advice and help with, and I hope OSC is the right body to bring up such a discussion; forgive me if its not. One way to prioritise (and this has been actually proposed in the meeting) is by amount of work: do simple things first, more difficult things later. This would work in this particular case, but since we are thinking about robust governance mechanisms we must also think ahead and think about situations where a flood of minute tasks prevents us from delivering some more critical changes. In this case a solution would be to use software quality attributes as our measuring stick, and agree that e.g. we prefer security over UX, so vulnerabilities must be addressed first even if it's a lot of work, while UI fixes are deferred. We could use ISO 5055 standard, which has a decent number of attributes, with the claim that they are actually measurable. However it's not open source, and needs to be bought like any other ISO standard. I hoped that this work was cut out for us by the OSC, but trying to frame the problem using OSC strategy I find myself stuck because the values are somewhat general and I don't understand how to apply them in this context. What source of ground truth should be used for prioritising tasks for project development under the umbrella of Intersect? Can you suggest a short list (3 to 7) of attributes which we could use for backlog prioritisation? Maybe you can recommend an open source alternative to ISO which I could study to find a documentation of such kind? Thank you!",
